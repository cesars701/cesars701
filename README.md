# Hello! My name is Cesar and I am a newbie at coding! 😊

- I am a Computer Engineering major and hopefully minoring in art.
- I love working with technology, but also drawing and painting is my go to hobby. 
- This is my first time working on coding, so I am not very good at it. Through this course I hope to get some of the basics down!
- ⭐ Fun fact, I love to play video games. ⭐
- 🌈 Anyways! Thanks for reading my bio 🌈
